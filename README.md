Thought for 3 seconds### Deep Research AI: Project Explanation Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Introduction

Deep Research AI is an advanced research assistant designed to automate the process of gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information from the web. The system employs a dual-agent architecture to separate the concerns of information gathering and analysis generation, resulting in more comprehensive and well-structured research outputs.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The Deep Research AI system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

[PLACEHOLDER: Insert high-level architecture diagram showing the main components and their interactions]

The system consists of the following main components:

1. **Web Interface**: Flask-based frontend for user interactions
2. **Research Agent**: Responsible for generating search queries and gathering information
3. **Drafting Agent**: Responsible for analyzing gathered information and generating comprehensive reports
4. **Database Layer**: MongoDB for document storage and ChromaDB for vector embeddings
5. **API Clients**: Interfaces for Tavily (search) and Groq (LLM) APIs
6. **Rate Limiter**: System for managing API usage within rate limits


### 2.2 Data Flow

The data flows through the system as follows:

1. User submits a research query through the web interface
2. The query is processed by the Flask backend, which creates a new research session
3. The Research Agent generates search queries based on the original query
4. These search queries are sent to the Tavily API to gather information from the web
5. Search results are stored in both MongoDB (for persistence) and ChromaDB (for vector search)
6. The Drafting Agent retrieves the gathered information and generates a comprehensive analysis
7. The analysis is stored in MongoDB and presented to the user through the web interface
8. The user can view the analysis, complete with citations and references


### 2.3 Component Interactions

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Research Agent

The Research Agent is implemented using LangGraph to manage a multi-step workflow:

1. **Query Generation**: The agent first analyzes the user's research topic and generates multiple specific search queries to gather diverse information. This is done using the Groq LLM API with a specialized prompt.
2. **Search Execution**: The agent then executes these search queries using the Tavily API, which returns structured search results from the web.
3. **Result Processing**: The search results are processed, deduplicated, and stored in both MongoDB and ChromaDB for later retrieval.


The Research Agent uses a state-based approach with LangGraph, allowing for conditional branching based on the success or failure of each step. This ensures robust error handling and recovery.

### 3.2 Drafting Agent

The Drafting Agent is responsible for generating a comprehensive analysis based on the gathered information:

1. **Information Retrieval**: The agent retrieves the research data collected by the Research Agent.
2. **Analysis Generation**: Using the Groq LLM API, the agent generates a structured analysis with proper sections, citations, and formatting.
3. **Quality Assurance**: The agent ensures the analysis meets minimum length requirements and properly cites all references.


The Drafting Agent uses a sophisticated prompt template that specifies the structure, length requirements, and citation format for the analysis. This ensures consistent, high-quality outputs.

### 3.3 Database Design

The system uses two database technologies:

1. **MongoDB**: Used for storing:

1. Chat sessions and their metadata
2. User queries and timestamps
3. Search results and references
4. Generated analyses
5. Application settings



2. **ChromaDB**: Used as a vector database for:

1. Storing research data with vector embeddings
2. Enabling semantic search capabilities
3. Facilitating retrieval of relevant information





This dual-database approach allows for both traditional document storage and advanced vector-based retrieval.

### 3.4 Web Interface

The web interface is built using Flask, HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript:

Key features of the interface include:

1. **Research Input**: A clean, simple interface for entering research queries
2. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates on the research progress
3. **Reference Display**: A sidebar showing all references found during research
4. **Analysis View**: A formatted view of the generated analysis with clickable citations
5. **Chat History**: Access to previous research sessions
6. **Settings**: Configuration options for the AI models

### 3.5 API Integrations

The system integrates with two external APIs:

1. **Tavily API**: Used for web search and information gathering

1. Handles search query execution
2. Returns structured search results
3. Provides relevance scores for results



2. **Groq API**: Used for LLM-based text generation

1. Generates search queries from research topics
2. Creates comprehensive analyses from research data
3. Supports various LLM models with different capabilities





### 3.6 Rate Limiting System

A sophisticated rate limiting system was implemented to manage API usage:

1. **Model Selection**: Automatically selects the best available model based on current usage
2. **Usage Tracking**: Tracks both request counts and token usage for each model
3. **Time-based Reset**: Resets usage counters after specified time intervals
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: Provides fallback options when rate limits are reached


## 4. Technical Decisions

### 4.1 Why a Dual-Agent Architecture?

The decision to implement a dual-agent architecture was based on the principle of separation of concerns:

1. **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent can focus on its specific task, leading to better performance
2. **Workflow Management**: Easier to manage and debug the research process
3. **Scalability**: Easier to add additional agents for specialized tasks in the future
4. **Error Isolation**: Issues in one agent don't necessarily affect the other


This approach allows the Research Agent to focus on breadth (gathering diverse information) while the Drafting Agent focuses on depth (creating a coherent, comprehensive analysis).

### 4.2 Why LangGraph?

LangGraph was chosen as the workflow management framework for several reasons:

1. **State Management**: Provides robust state management for complex workflows
2. **Conditional Branching**: Allows for dynamic decision-making based on intermediate results
3. **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms for handling and recovering from errors
4. **Visualization**: Supports visualization of the workflow for debugging and monitoring
5. **Integration with LangChain**: Seamless integration with LangChain components


### 4.3 Database Selection Rationale

The decision to use both MongoDB and ChromaDB was based on their complementary strengths:

1. **MongoDB**:

1. Document-oriented storage ideal for structured data
2. ACID transactions for data integrity
3. Mature ecosystem with robust tooling
4. Excellent for storing metadata, settings, and analysis results



2. **ChromaDB**:

1. Specialized for vector embeddings
2. Efficient similarity search capabilities
3. Lightweight and easy to integrate
4. Perfect for semantic retrieval of research data





### 4.4 Frontend Technology Choices

The frontend was built using a combination of Flask, HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and vanilla JavaScript:

1. **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework that integrates well with the backend
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
3. **Vanilla JavaScript**: No heavy frameworks needed for the relatively simple UI interactions


This approach prioritized simplicity, performance, and ease of integration with the Python backend.

## 5. Challenges and Solutions
